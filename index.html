    <p class=aboutme>My full name is Ashley Kailey Colinet and I was born and raised in Miami, FL. I've always felt trapped here, and I want to move somewhere else so completely and totally far away, once I am able to. The arts have always been a passion of mine but I always knew it was an extremely competitive and unreliable field so I looked to IT. Althought not my first choice, I've always been fascinated in technology; how screens are made and messages are sent especially when once we were just surronded by nature and that from nature, this amazing technology was created and improved upon.</p>
    <p class=aboutme>I come from a mixed background but I mostly consider myself Haitian, since that was the culture I grew up surrounded by.</p>
